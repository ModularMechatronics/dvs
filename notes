Set percentual margin from edge that is min allowed margin
E.g., margin = 0.1, then left edge should be no closer than 0.1 * width of window

Scale = [sx, sy, sz]

proj(p) = [p.x, p.y]


We have a point p0 = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
pr = R * p0
To get from point proj(R * p0 * s) = [width * tx, height * ty]

sx = width * tx / pr.x


There is an invisible rectangular funnel that sets the limits of the extreme points of the plot box
