Generic visualization tool which one can visualize data on the fly by simply dropping
a binary file/path/log config files into the application, which then gets decoded by a customer written decoder
and plotter module which decodes the raw binary data, and then plots it using the
different available plotting functions. There should be support for simple gui elements
like buttons, sliders, combobox, etc...

Things to plot:
 * Sets of signals
 * Playback/scrubbing of realtime signal
 * Playback/scrubbing of video/point cloud frames

Using a configuration file (for the layout of the windows and plots and buttons) and a
customer written data converter/decoder that gets loaded dynamically at startup (specified in the 
configuration file).
