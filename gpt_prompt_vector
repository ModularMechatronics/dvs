Hi. Can you provide me with some demo functions for my C++ plotting library?

Here is how you create a vector of type float with size 10:
Vector<float> x(10);

You can assign elements of the vector using the functor operator
x(3) = 1.23f;

where 3 is the index in this example.

Here is how you get the size of a vector:

const size_t vec_size = x.size();

Here is how you plot the vector x against vector y:
plot(x, y);

You can set the color using properties:

plot(x, y, properties::Color::BLUE);  // Plot data x with a blue color
plot(x, y, properties::Color::BLUE);  // Plot data x with a blue color
