 - setCurrentElement doesn't send any information to dvs, only sets internal variable on client side which is sent with the next command
  - This way, a property type could be added, so that the current element can be specified in the function call
 - The class Properties should be moved so that it is not included in the C++ client interface.
 - Create another class called something like HeaderPayload, that separates values (angle, axis bounds etc) from flags?
 - Create data structure to store properties in, instead of having to specify everything in function call to "plot" etc. i.e. "plot(x, y, props)"
 - Default layout templates with simple names and ex 2x2 plots, 3x3 plots etc
 - Add "owns_memory_" field to Matrix, Vector, to signify if data should be freed
 - Add "holdClear" that only clears when new data comes in, to avoid flashing
 - More general plot interface with "templated templates": plot(const VectorType<T>& x, ...), where VectorType itself is a template
 - Edge and Facecolor transparent
 - Generic "buffer" class that can be used to send Line3D, Triangles, etc.
 - Remove need to always specify num_elements
 - Verify that image is not mirrored
 - Function "view" is the one that sets/creates the current element
   view("ViewName"), view("ViewName", "FigureName"), where FigureName can be "main" to indicate the main window
 - Support no properties for C functions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5891221/variadic-macros-with-zero-arguments
 - Rename HomogenousLine and ParametricLine to HLine and Pline?
 - Change void drawPlaneXY etc. interfaces to match between languages (C implementation is correct)
 - Rename Vec2D/3D/4D to Vec2/3/4
 - Unify function names in interfaces, allow for different names between interfaces, e.g. C interface will probably have separate
     2D/3D functions
 - Rename "linspaceFromPointsAndCount" to "linspaceEdgesAndCount" or "linspaceBoundariesAndCount"

#### Bigger features
 - Fix so that one can set axis square and axis equal
 - Nice characters with AA
 - Characters turning away from plot box when rotating
 - Reducing number of axis numbers depending on rotation
 - Zoom rectangle if snapped
 - Don't zoom perpendicular axis if snapped
 - Linux support
 - Making sure that view and axes are set properly when not explicitly setting them
  - Behaviour when plotting when no configuration is set
 - Imshow 1 and 3 channels + arbitrary data type
 - Set icons for zoon, pan and rotate
