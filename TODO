 - setCurrentElement doesn't send any information to dvs, only sets internal variable on client side which is sent with the next command
  - This way, a property type could be added, so that the current element can be specified in the function call
 - Add another byte in the transmission which indicates if the transmission is sent over several segments (segmented transmission)
 - The class Properties should be moved so that it is not included in the C++ client interface.
 - use pushToCore instead of sendData?
 - Create another class called something like HeaderPayload, that separates values (angle, axis bounds etc) from flags?
 - Create data structure to store properties in, instead of having to specify everything in function call to "plot" etc. i.e. "plot(x, y, props)"
 - Default layouts with simple names and ex 2x2 plots, 3x3 plots etc
 - Delete/add tab only available in edit mode
 - Rename 'ProjectFile' to 'ProjectSettings'
 - Saving, despite not having made any changes, changes the project json file
 - Add "holdClear" that only clears when new data comes in, to avoid flashing
 - More general plot interface with "templated templates": plot(const VectorType<T>& x, ...), where VectorType itself is a template
 - Edge and Facecolor transparent
 - Generic "buffer" class that can be used to send Line3D, Triangles, etc.
 - Remove need to always specify num_elements
