 - setCurrentElement doesn't send any information to dvs, only sets internal variable on client side which is sent with the next command
 - Add another byte in the transmission which indicates if the transmission is sent over several segments (segmented transmission)
 - The class Properties should be moved so that it is not included in the C++ client interface.
 - use pushToCore instead of sendData?
 - Create another class called something like HeaderPayload, that separates values (angle, axis bounds etc) from flags?
 - Create data structure to store properties in, instead of having to specify everything in function call to "plot" etc. i.e. "plot(x, y, props)"
