### Duoplot

Welcome to Duoplot, a simple plotting application with interface in Python, C and C++.

# Limitations
 * The data that is plotted is converted to floats, so the precision is limited to 7 decimal places, and the range is limited to 1e-38 to 1e38.
 * Axes numbers system needs some adaptations to handle small ranges centered around large numbers.
